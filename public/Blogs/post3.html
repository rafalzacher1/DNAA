                <p>DNA is a student-run, student-oriented cooperative for Drug and Alcohol Awareness, and was founded by third-year student Alexia T Mandrà. DNA acknowledges drug usage on campus as a part of student life, and rather than encouraging or condemning drug use, DNA operates as a neutral, safe space to educate and reduce misuse of recreational drugs and alcohol on campus.<br></p>
                <p>DNA essentially challenges and tries to address the issues surrounding drug use in a healthy and educated way as a means of making progress, such as offering support for those who suffer from substance abuse instead of punitive measures. Their manifesto (available online) gives a comprehensive list of our aims.<br></p>
                <p>Alexia enlisted other students to create a passionate and multi-faceted team with a variety of skills, ensuring that the student voice is heard at Royal Holloway. DNA has become a thriving outlet, where the skills of our team can be channelled into protecting the safety and welfare of students on campus.<br></p>
                <h4><strong>What has DNA done so far?</strong><br></h4>
                <p>It’s been a busy year for DNA!<br></p>
                <p>DNA has a thriving and passionate community, which is plain to see from any of their many events. Prior to UK lockdown restrictions DNA hosted many events both on and off campus, such as an open mic night to raise money for charity. Through creating a vocal and vibrant student community, DNA has opened up a conversation about how drugs are treated on campus by both the university and the students, and their message has reached the ears of many previously unwilling to listen. This community has notably spread further than just campus, however; DNA has created an equally interactive online community, collaborating with artists and creatives to help effectively communicate via social media. DNA has also spent much of the year fundraising within the community to purchase drug testing kits for students on campus. These kits are vital as they test the purity of drugs, reducing harm and encouraging safer drug culture.<br></p>
                <p>As well embedding themselves into the heart of student life at Royal Holloway and creating their own community, DNA has put their money where their mouth is and has worked as an intermediary voice between students and the university.<br></p>
                <p>This year has been spent working closely with student bodies such as the SU and the Wellbeing Centre amongst others to push for active change in the attitudes and policies regarding drug use on campus. DNA’s collaboration with the Wellbeing Centre has seen much of the existing literature on substance use be rewritten, emphasising the importance of safety and awareness and culminating in the fondly named ‘Drug Bible’. They have also had ongoing talks with the SU regarding student support and drug policies on campus, and are ultimately hoping to help the SU provide better facilities for students suffering with substance abuse issues. One of the highlights of the year was DNA’s TEDxRoyalHolloway takeover, in which DNA spent a week hosting a series of talks with professionals and researchers to discuss drug culture, policies, health and more.<br></p>
                <p>These feats only highlight a few key things that DNA have made happen, but hopefully it is enough of a flavour to show you how thoroughly the group have thrown themselves in and made change happen!<br></p>
                <h4><strong>What’s in the pipeline for DNA?</strong><br></h4>
                <p>One of the biggest struggles for DNA is managing to sustain the momentum and communication built over the academic year prior to lockdown, but this strange year has brought its challenges and excitement to the organisation.<br></p>
                <p>Considering the recent protests, it is important to be very clear: it is impossible to open up a conversation surrounding drug culture and policy and ignore how discriminately people of colour are affected by drug policies. A simple search will show you how black people, for example, are far more likely to be stopped, searched, and prosecuted for drug law violations than white people. This being said, it is also impossible to create a safe space for students and understanding substance use without recognising the black experience of drug culture; therefore, DNA has amended the manifesto to specifically recognise and provide space for black students and creatives. After all, as it is ‘systemic racism [that] fuels the discriminatory measures that underpin drug policies’, DNA want to be very clear on their stance: there is no place for morally and ethically repugnant policies rooted in racism. DNA has also offered its platform in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, hoping to decolonise the narrative and promote a better understanding of race dynamics in relation drug politics, drug safety and wellbeing.<br></p>
                <p>DNA is also proud to be spearheading a Drug Kit Donation scheme, where students will be able to donate any amount of money and in return receive a drug testing kit. They are keen to promote drug safety through making the kits accessible and affordable to any student; and, in addition, DNA will be matching donations from the drug kits purchased. The money will be donated to support black charities who deal with race and the war on drugs.<br></p>
                <p>As with any organisation, there’s always a bit of admin, and DNA are currently recruiting next year’s committee. It will be exciting to see what direction the new team will be taking DNA in, and the next academic year will bring more progress, more understanding, and more opportunity.<br></p>
